1. group.attribute works for everything BESIDES group.owner ... This could be because of it being a related field
    (fixed using the StringRelatedField in models.py) (done)
2. When using @api_view, the POST is "Forbidden", because of CSRF since we are posting without authentication
3. Let people join a group, making sure to increment group.num
4. Need to redirect back to groupList upon deleting group, and upon creating group
5. Enable login from pressing enter, and redirect home upon successful login, and redirect back to login on failure.
6. Delete group ONLY if you are the one who created the group.
7. Can access group detail ONLY if you are in the group.
    - If url is "group/x" and the owner of that group is not you OR is invalid, then redirect back to group list
8. Redirects are not immediate
9. User not found on incorrect login
